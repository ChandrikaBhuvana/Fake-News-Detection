# üì∞ Fake News Detection App

This is a **simple end-to-end machine learning project** that detects whether a news article is **Real** or **Fake**. It is designed to help understand the **complete ML workflow** from data preprocessing and model training to building an interactive web app and deploying it.

## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a minimal yet functional **fake news classifier** and deploy it using **Streamlit**, making it accessible to anyone without needing to run Python code manually.

It demonstrates key ML and deployment skills, including:

- Data preprocessing with pandas
- Text vectorization using **TF-IDF**
- Training a fast and interpretable model: **PassiveAggressiveClassifier**
- Model evaluation and saving (`pickle`)
- **Building a web app** using Streamlit
- Running and deploying the app locally or on platforms like **Streamlit Cloud**

## üß† Machine Learning Skills Showcased

- **Text classification** using natural language processing (NLP)
- Feature extraction using `TfidfVectorizer`
- Model training with scikit-learn
- Accuracy measurement and confusion matrix
- Serialization of model and vectorizer (`pickle`)
- Loading models for real-time inference

## üöÄ Deployment

This project uses **Streamlit** to create an intuitive web interface where users can paste a news article and get instant predictions.

- You can run it locally with:
  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
- Or deploy it to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) for free, with just a GitHub repo and one click.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detector.git
   cd fake-news-detector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Paste any news article text to see if it‚Äôs **REAL** or **FAKE**.
